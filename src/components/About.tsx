    My name is Israel Mateus Matusse. I'm 23 years old and passionate about software development. <br />
    My journey as a developer started at the university, where I learned the basics of programming and was exposed to different programming languages, <br />
    such as C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and HTML. <br />
    I graduated in Engineering of Technologies and Information Systems.

        <p>
         in 2021 I transitioned into the professional sphere, where I am currently engaged in the dynamic field of technology. <br />
           As a Programmer Analyst, I primarily focus on backend development, leveraging technologies such as Spring Boot, Node Js, react Js and many others. <br />
            My journey in the tech industry has been marked by continuous learning, and my dedication to mastering new skills and technologies remains unwavering. <br />
             My commitment to growth and innovation is a driving force as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
